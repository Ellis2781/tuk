# tuk
A git based package manager written in C

This project is not yet complete but in somewhat working condition

The purpose of this project is to build the base for my sel4-bsd project. The idea of having to build and maintain a large amount of packages regularly seemed like a very redundant idea to me. Why not just have a system in place to do this by itself? Github already has a very large collection of software just waiting to be built so why not use it? 

This project isn't intended to be sel4 exclusive so this might as well be a highly portable package manager too.
